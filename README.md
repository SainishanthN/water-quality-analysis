Water quality analysis
Description: Provide a brief description of the project, explaining that it's a Flask web application for predicting water quality based on input features using a pre-trained machine learning model.

Libraries Used:

Mention the libraries used in the project, such as Flask, sklearn, pandas, numpy, and joblib. These libraries are essential for creating the web application, performing machine learning tasks, and handling data.
Model and Scaler Loading:

Explain that the project loads a pre-trained machine learning model (model.pkl) and a scaler (my_scaler.save) using pickle and joblib libraries, respectively. These components are necessary for making predictions on input data.
Routes and Endpoints:

Describe the Flask routes and endpoints used in the application.
Explain that the /home and / routes render a template named predict.html, which contains a form for inputting features.
Mention that the /predict route handles form submissions, preprocesses the input data, makes predictions using the loaded model, and renders the prediction result on the same template.
Input Features:

List the input features used for water quality prediction, such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity. These features are used to determine whether the water is safe for human consumption.
Output:

Explain that the output of the prediction is displayed on the web page, indicating whether the water is safe or not for human consumption.
Running the Application:

Provide instructions on how to run the Flask application locally, such as installing the required dependencies and executing the Python script containing the Flask application (app.py).
Further Improvements:

Optionally, you can mention potential improvements or future work for the project, such as deploying the application to a web server, enhancing the user interface, or incorporating additional features or models for better prediction accuracy.
